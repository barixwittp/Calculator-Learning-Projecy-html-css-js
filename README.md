This project is a simple calculator web app that includes the following key features:

Calculator Functionality:
Users can perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using an on-screen calculator interface.
The input is displayed as the user clicks the buttons, and the result is calculated when the "=" button is pressed.

History Log:
The app keeps track of previous calculations. 
Each time a calculation is performed, the expression and result are saved and displayed in a history section, allowing users to review their past inputs.

Light/Dark Mode:
The app includes a toggle switch to change between light mode and dark mode.
This enhances user experience by adjusting the background color and aesthetics based on preference.

Interactive UI: Buttons are interactive with sound effects and hover animations to enhance user engagement.
The app also includes features like clear (AC) and delete (DEL) to manage the input.

Responsive Design:
The app's layout is designed to be flexible, adjusting for various screen sizes and providing a smooth, 
user-friendly experience across devices.

Overall, this project combines a functional calculator with interactive and aesthetic elements to create a polished web application.
